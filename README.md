# ServerRun
ServerRun is a lightweight script which helps beginners start their server easier with a GUI. Tested on Paper.


HOW TO USE SERVERRUN

1. Download the paper server software here: [https://papermc.io/downloads/paper]
2. Place it into a folder anywhere you want
3. Rename it to "paper.jar"
4. Download ServerRun [https://github.com/iLovePrizes/ServerRun/releases]
5. Place ServerRun into the SAME folder as the "paper.jar" file
6. Start the ServerRun program. It will ask you how much ram to allocate. Put something equal or less than half of your device's memory.


   WARNING:

If you are hosting a public server,
DO NOT START YOUR SERVER AS ADMINISTRATOR.

It's a best practice only to provide the server
the permissions it needs, such as accessing ONLY this
folder.

If you proceed to run a public server with administrator permissions, 
an exploit making hackers get
access to your server, can ALSO GET ACCESS TO YOUR
WHOLE MACHINE AND YOUR DEVICES CONNECTED ON THE SAME
NETWORK. We recommend you open this as a normal user,
as if hackers get access to the server, they can only
do harmful stuff on THAT SPECIFIC SERVER, and not your
whole computer and other devices.
